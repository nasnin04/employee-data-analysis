# Employee Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes employee data from ABC Company to derive key insights using Python. The dataset contains *458 rows and 9 columns*, including employee details such as age, team, position, salary, and height.

## *Overview of the Project*
The project focuses on:
1. *Preprocessing*:  
   - Corrected the "height" column with random values between 150 and 180.  
   - Ensured data consistency and integrity.

2. *Analysis Tasks*:  
   - Distribution of employees across teams.  
   - Segregation of employees based on their positions.  
   - Identification of the predominant age group.  
   - Determination of the team and position with the highest salary expenditure.  
   - Investigation of the correlation between age and salary.

3. *Graphical Representations*:  
   - Bar charts and pie charts visualize team distributions, positions, and salary expenditures.  
   - Scatter plot shows correlations between age and salary.

4. *Insights*:  
   - Key trends and patterns observed include:
     - Most employees belong to Team A.  
     - The predominant age group is 31-40.  
     - Position "Manager" has the highest salary expenditure.  
     - A weak correlation exists between age and salary.
